# Bookstore API 

## Application overview

The API was developed in Node.js from scratch as a way of learning. Routes, controllers and models were created and the application was connected to a MongoDB database in the cloud.

The Express and Mongoose libraries were used, which are widely consolidated in Web development with Node.

There is the complete CRUD of two resources ("livros" and "autores"), personalized queries by field, as well as the association of data from a resource in the route that searches for the other resource.
